= Creating the Service Broker Service

[abstract]
This page describes how to install the Service Broker into your Kubernetes cluster.

Installation is divided into a number of steps.
The Service Broker comes with different configurations that define what service will be created by the Service Broker and what permissions it requires to do so.
A configuration will be installed first, followed by the generic Service Broker deployment, then finally it will be registered with the Kubernetes Service Catalog.

.Environment Requirements
[IMPORTANT]
====
This tutorial--and, in fact, all examples--assume you are using the `default` namespace.
Due to explicit `default` namespace references in role bindings and TLS certificates, this tutorial will not work with any other namespace.
====

== Install CRDs

The Service Broker is configured using a Kubernetes Custom Resource that allows type checking of your configurations and must be installed first:

[source,console]
----
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbase/service-broker/master/crds/servicebroker.couchbase.com_servicebrokerconfigs.yaml
----

== Install a Configuration

Example configurations are available through https://github.com/couchbase/service-broker/tree/master/examples/configurations[GitHub^].
For the purposes of this demonstration, we will use Couchbase Server:

[source,console]
----
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbase/service-broker/master/examples/configurations/couchbase-server/broker.yaml
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/couchbase-service-broker created
servicebrokerconfig.servicebroker.couchbase.com/couchbase-service-broker created
----

.Schema Validation
[TIP]
====
At this point, the Kubernetes API may reject the `ServiceBrokerConfig` resource if you have have made any modifications.
Errors will be based on the https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/[OpenAPI schema specification^].
====

.Licensing and Prerequisite Requirements
[IMPORTANT]
====
The Couchbase Server configuration uses the https://www.couchbase.com/products/cloud/kubernetes[Couchbase Autonomous Operator^] to provision service instances.
Use of the Couchbase Autonomous Operator is governed by the https://www.couchbase.com/LA11122019[Couchbase License Agreement Version 7^].

The Couchbase Server configuration requires the installation of custom resource definitions, and a dynamic admission controller to provide defaults to custom resource attributes.
The Service Broker examples use a namespace-scoped role and cannot create the cluster-scoped resources required.
You will need to manually https://docs.couchbase.com/operator/2.0/install-kubernetes.html[install the CRDs and dynamic admission controller^] before proceeding.
====

== Install the Service Broker Service

The Service Broker is installed with a single configuration file:

[source,console]
----
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbase/service-broker/master/examples/broker.yaml
serviceaccount/couchbase-service-broker created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/couchbase-service-broker created
secret/couchbase-service-broker created
deployment.apps/couchbase-service-broker created
service/couchbase-service-broker created
----

The `ServiceAccount` the Service Broker runs as is bound to the `Role` we created in the previous step.
A `Secret` contains the TLS configuration and bearer token for authentication as the Service Broker is secure by default.
The `Deployment` creates the Service Broker and ensures it is highly available and a `Service` makes it discoverable by the Kubernetes Service Catalog in the next step.

.Using Non-Standard Container Image Names
[NOTE]
====
Is you are using a non-standard container image name or container registry, you will need to download and edit the `Deployment` to reference your image before creating in Kubernetes.
====

As it is a regular deployment with a readiness probe, you can check that the Service Broker is up and running with the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ kubectl get deployments
NAME                           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
couchbase-service-broker       1/1     1            1           17s
----

Alternatively, you can wait for the `Deployment` to become available:

[source,console]
----
$ kubectl wait --for=condition=Available deployment/couchbase-service-broker
deployment.extensions/couchbase-service-broker condition met
----

.Service Broker Validation
[TIP]
====
The Service Broker does not use a dynamic admission controller to validate the configuration at present.
It does, however, perform validation internally and report this back to the user through a status in the configuration resource.
If you have made a configuration error, the Service Broker `Deployment` will not become ready.
You can see the validation status directly through the CLI:

[source,console]
----
$ kubectl get servicebrokerconfigs
NAME                       VALID   AGE
couchbase-service-broker   True    9m
----

If you have a configuration error, you can examine this in more detail with the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ kubectl describe servicebrokerconfigs
Status:
  Conditions:
    Last Transition Time:  2020-04-06T15:51:17Z
    Message:               template 'couchbase-operator-rolebinding', referenced by binding 'couchbase-developer-private' service instance, must exist
    Reason:                ValidationFailed
    Status:                False
    Type:                  ConfigurationValid
----
====

== Register the Service Broker with the Service Catalog

The final step is to tell the Kubernetes Service Catalog about our Service Broker.
Again this is done with a single configuration file:

[source,console]
----
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbase/service-broker/master/examples/clusterservicebroker.yaml
clusterservicebroker.servicecatalog.k8s.io/couchbase-service-broker created
----

If this is successful, it will appear as `Ready`:

[source,console]
----
$ kubectl get clusterservicebrokers
NAME                       URL                                            STATUS   AGE
couchbase-service-broker   https://couchbase-service-broker.default.svc   Ready    2s
----
