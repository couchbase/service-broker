With the Service Broker installed and registered with the Kubernetes Service Catalog, we can now start provisioning service instances and binding to them.

== Creating a Service Instance

Before continuing, I'd like to draw attention to the configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceInstance
metadata:
  name: test-instance # <1>
spec:
  clusterServiceClassExternalName: couchbase-developer # <2>
  clusterServicePlanExternalName: couchbase-developer-private # <3>
  parameters: # <4>
    password: password
    size: 3
----

That's it!
All that is required now for an end user to provision a fully featured in-memory database cluster, is a handful of lines of configuration.
Here's a taste of what's to come:

<1> The instance has a unique, human-readable name.
<2> The user specifies a class of service instance, in this case I want something suitable for development.
<3> Within the class there are plans, I want something that is private--not exposed to the outside world.
    All the domain specific complexity about a service--how it is configured and managed--is completely abstracted away.
    The user merely consumes a service.
<4> Plans can be parameterized.
    The administrator in control of the Service Broker configuration can explicitly control what about a plan is configurable by the end user.

Create the service instance:

[source,console]
----
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbase/service-broker/master/examples/configurations/couchbase-server/serviceinstance.yaml
serviceinstance.servicecatalog.k8s.io/test-instance created
----

The Service Broker will handle creating the service instance and ensuring it is running properly.
Like the Service Broker `Deployment`, the `ServiceInstance` type can be monitored for completion:

[source,console]
----
$ kubectl get serviceinstances
NAME            CLASS                                     PLAN                          STATUS   AGE
test-instance   ClusterServiceClass/couchbase-developer   couchbase-developer-private   Ready    118s
----

Our service instance will report `Ready` when successfully provisioned.

== Creating a Service Binding

Creating a database instance is one thing, consuming it is another.
For our service instance to be useful, we need user credentials and a bucket to store data.
This is where service bindings come in:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: test-binding
spec:
  instanceRef:
    name: test-instance # <1>
  secret-name: test-binding # <2>
----

Again, it's that simple.

<1> The instance reference refers to the name of our service instance created in the previous step.
<2> Credentials are returned to the user as a secret.
    An application can consume these credentials by setting environment variables in a `Pod` sourced from the `Secret`, or simply mount it as a volume mount.

To create the binding:

[source,console]
----
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbase/service-broker/master/examples/configurations/couchbase-server/servicebinding.yaml
servicebinding.servicecatalog.k8s.io/test-binding created
----

And like the service instance, you can check for completion with a `Ready` status:

[source,console]
----
$ kubectl get servicebindings
NAME           SERVICE-INSTANCE   SECRET-NAME    STATUS   AGE
test-binding   test-instance      test-binding   Ready    10m
----

=== Consuming a Service Binding

Let's reexamine the service binding `Secret` mentioned in the last step.
When the service binding is successfully created, the Service Broker responds with credentials--as defined by the Service Broker configuration--which are placed into a secret:

[source,console]
----
$ kubectl get secret/test-binding -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  bucket: YmluZGluZy0xNzIzNmZmYy03MDJlLTExZWEtOTQ1Yi0wMjQyYWMxMTAwMDc=

What has happened behind the scenes is that the creation of a service binding has created a bucket and a user, then granted that user full permissions to that bucket.
This demonstrates how service instances can be shared in a multi-tenant environment.

Looking at the `Secret`, you can see the Service Broker has responded with a CA certificate--to allow TLS verification, a connection string--to be consumed directly by client SDKs, a username and password--for authentication and authorization, and finally a bucket--to use for data storage and queries.

When made available inside a container for example, it would see the following connection string:

[source,console]
----
$ echo -n Y291Y2hiYXNlczovL2luc3RhbmNlLXNzOGxxeGxvLXNydi5kZWZhdWx0 | base64 -d

== Next Steps

You have seen just a taste of what the Service Broker can offer.
Next you should read our learning resources that describe the key concepts of the Service Broker architecture and how it works.
From there you can begin to configure your own service instances and bindings for any service you desire.

Additionally you may wish to expose your Service Broker instance on the internet to integrate with services other than the Kubernetes Service Catalog.
