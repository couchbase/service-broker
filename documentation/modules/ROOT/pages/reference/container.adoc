The Service Broker requires very little configuration to start using it--the vast majority is handled through the `ServiceBrokerConfig` Kubernetes resource.
For the most part, the examples will suffice for simple proof-of-concept deployments.
For production deployments, you may require the Service Broker to be run in a non-`default` namespace, or with enhanced logging.
This section details the modifications that can be made along with requirements.

[#arguments]
== Command Line Arguments

-logtostderr::

The Service Broker currently uses `glog` to report logging.
By default this logs to files, it needs to be redirected to the console to correctly integrate with Kubernetes.
This argument should always be present.

-v value::

The Service Broker has multiple log levels to control the verbosity of log output.
If not specified, this will default to "0" and show only informational logs.
The Service Broker also supports log level "1" to include debug logging.
Debug logging should be used with caution as verbose API logging will reveal API credentials.

-tls-certificate string::

The Service Broker must use TLS to provide network level security.
The TLS certificate argument must be a path to a PEM formatted X.509 TLS certificate, valid for the Service Broker's Kubernetes `Service` resource.
This argument defaults to `/var/run/secrets/service-broker/tls-certificate`.

-tls-private-key string::

The Service Broker must use TLS to provide network level security.
The TLS private key argument must be a path to a PEM formatted private key.
This argument defaults to `/var/run/secrets/service-broker/tls-private-key`.

-authentication::

The service broker must use some form of authentication.
A value of `basic` means username and password, and `-username` and `-password` flags are used to load credentials.
A value of `token` means bearer token authentication, and the `-token` flag is used to load credentials.
This argument defaults to `basic`.

-username::

The Service Broker may use basic authentication to provide API level protection against malicious attacks.
The username argument must be a path to a file containing a bearer token string.
This argument defaults to `/var/run/secrets/service-broker/username`.

-password::

The Service Broker may use basic authentication to provide API level protection against malicious attacks.
The password argument must be a path to a file containing a bearer token string.
This argument defaults to `/var/run/secrets/service-broker/password`.

-token string::

The Service Broker may use bearer token authentication to provide API level protection against malicious attacks.
The token argument must be a path to a file containing a bearer token string.
This argument defaults to `/var/run/secrets/service-broker/token`.

-config string::

The Service Broker allows the configuration resource name to be modified to suit your needs.
This may, for example, be used to allow multiple Service Brokers to exist in the same namespace.
This argument defaults to `couchbase-service-broker`.
