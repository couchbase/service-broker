In the xref:concepts/templates.adoc[last section] we described configuration templates and how they are used to generate valid Kubernetes resources.
In this section we will look in detail at dynamic attributes, how they work, what they can do and how they can make your service instances truly dynamic.

While this section focuses on dynamic attributes of resource templates, the same language syntax is used to process configuration binding registry definitions.

== Dynamic Attributes

Dynamic attributes are best thought of as functions: they accept input arguments and return a single result.
Dynamic attributes do not have any side effects.

In general, dynamic attributes use the Go language https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/[template^] library with a few specializations.
Control flow is allowed, however, each dynamic attribute should execute at one action in order to generate a value.
Dot is not defined initially, all data must be accessed though accessor functions.
Iteration is not supported.

=== Dynamic Attribute Typing

The key thing to note is that Go language templating operates on text.
Text has no concept of type (other than being a string) therefore all dynamic attributes must be serialized to JSON in order to preserve type information and allow the Service Broker to make the correct decisions.
The JSON serialization function is added implicitly, by the Service Broker, to all action pipelines that would usually generate template output.
All dynamic attributes are initially defined as strings, however the attribute itself takes on the type of the value returned by attribute template processing.

==== Optional Attributes

All attribute templates are optional by default.
This supports such use cases where parameters supplied by the end user--as defined by the xref:concepts/catalog.adoc#json-schemas[service catalog schemas]--are optional.
If a user defined parameter is not specified, but referred to by an attribute template, the parameter argument lookup fails and the result will be internally set to `nil`.
If a configuration parameter value is `nil`, then the attribute is unset.

By exploiting optional parameters and how they are handled by the Service Broker, you can create basic conditional elements to your templates.

==== Mandatory Attributes

As we have seen in our xref:concepts/templates.adoc#template-example[earlier template example], resource templates will not generate valid Kubernetes resources without certain attributes being populated.
This will manifest itself as a Kubernetes creation error, which may be difficult to debug.
You can catch these types of errors earlier, and with more context, by specifying that the parameter is required.

[source]
----
{{ parameter "/optional-parameter" | required }}
----

Unlike optional parameters, required parameters will raise an error if the result resolves to `nil`.
This will indicate the error as related to the specific named parameter in the named template.

== Service Broker Defined Functions

Service Broker defined functions are divided into categories based on their behavior.  These are:

* Accessors--these lookup data items.
* Mutators--these transform existing data items.
* Generators--these generate data items.
* Assertions--these perform error checking.

=== Accessors

Accessors do a simple lookup of a value from available data sources.

==== Registry

The registry is described in detail in the next section.
It is a typed key/value store.
A registry source for name `foo` will return any value associated with the registry key `foo` as in the following example:

[source]
----
{{ registry "fool" }}
----

==== Parameter

A parameter refers to a user specified parameter supplied with a create or update operation.
Parameters are a supplied as a free-form JSON object to the API.
The parameter function access to a string, number, array or object in the supplied JSON object.
Parameters are accessed with the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902[JSON pointer^] specification.
For example, given the parameters passed to the API:

[source,json]
----
{
  "size": 16,
  "resources": {
    "requests": {
      "cpu": "4",
      "memory": "16Gi"
    }
  }
}
----

A dynamic attribute of:

[source]
----
{{ parameter "/size" }}
----

would resolve to `"4"`.

A dynamic attribute of:

[source]
----
{{ parameter "/resources/requests" }}
----

would resolve to `{"cpu":"4","memory":"16Gi"}`.

==== Template Snippet

The snippet function enables generation of complex results, and recursive template generation.
A specific example could involve Kubernetes label selectors.
Resources are labeled with a set of values, label selectors then filter resources based on the same labels.
In both cases the labels are the same, and can be generated by a common template snippet, rather than duplicated.
Template snippets are the one case where a configuration template need not generate a Kubernetes resource.

To demonstrate consider the following configuration template snippet definition:

[source,yaml]
----
name: label-snippet
template:
  app: '{{ registry "my-app-name" }}' # <1>
----

<1> The `app` attribute is dynamically set to the value defined by the `my-app-name` registry key.

Therefore if the registry key `my-app-name` contained the value `merlin`, then the snippet would generate the result `{"app":"merlin"}`.

To use the snippet, the following configuration template shows how:

[source,yaml]
----
template:
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: my-secret
    labels: '{{ snippet "label-snippet" }}'
----

This would generate the following Kubernetes resource:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
  labels:
    app: merlin
----

==== Template Array Snippet

The array snippet function acts like the snippet function, but extends it to iterate across an array of inputs and provide them as "dot" parameters to the snippet.
Array snippets return arrays of values, and provide a form of iteration.

For example, consider the following parameters:

[source,json]
----
{
  "ports": [
    {"name":"http","port":80},
    {"name":"https","port":443},
  ]
}
----

You can define a snippet to generate Kubernetes ports:

[source,yaml]
----
name: port-snippet
template:
  name: {{ .name }}
  containerPort: {{ .port }}
  protocol: TCP
----

Then reference this snippet, and the parameter in your main pod template:

[source,yaml]
----
template:
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  spec:
    containers:
    - ports: '{{ snippetArray "port-snippet" (parameter "ports" | required) }}'
----

This will yield the following rendered template:

[source.yaml]
----
template:
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  spec:
    containers:
    - ports:
      - name: http
        containerPort: 80
        protocol: TCP
      - name: https
        containerPort: 443
        protocol: TCP
----

For further information on "dot" parameters, see the official Go language https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#hdr-Arguments[templating documentation^].

=== Mutators

Mutators allow data to be modified.

==== Default

The default function allows a dynamic attribute to have a value set when an optional input argument is not specified:

[source]
----
{{ parameter "/size" | default 3 }}
----

==== Upper

The upper function upper cases a string:

[source]
----
{{ upper "some string" }}
----

==== Lower

The lower function lower cases a string:

[source]
----
{{ lower "some string" }}
----

==== Title

The upper function upper cases a string:

[source]
----
{{ title "some string" }}
----

=== Generators

Generators create new values.
They may accept arguments that allow the generation functions to be dynamically configured.
Any cryptographic generators use cryptographically secure random number generators.

[#generate-password]
==== Generate Password

The password generator generates ephemeral passwords of a specific length and results in a string.
The dictionary of characters used to generate passwords defaults to `[a-zA-Z0-9]`, however this can be explicitly defined.
To generate a 32 character password:

[source]
----
{{ generatePassword 32 nil }}
----

==== Generate Key

The key generator creates a private key and results in a string containing a PEM encoded private key.
Supported key types are RSA, ECDSA and ED25519.
Supported encoding types are PKCS#1, PKCS#8 and SEC 1.

For example, to generate a PKCS#8 encoded P256 elliptic curve private key:

[source]
----
{{ generatePrivateKey "EllipticP256" "PKCS#8" nil }}
----

==== Generate Certificate

The certificate generator generates X.509 certificates and results in a string containing a PEM encoded certificate.
This generator optionally accepts a CA certificate and key pair with which to sign the resulting certificate.
If no CA is specified then the resulting certificate is self-signed.

The certificate generator supports CA, server and client certificate types.
Server and client certificates may be specified with DNS and e-mail subject alternative names respectively.

For example, to generate a signed X.509 certificate:

[source]
----
{{ generateCertificate (registry "my-key") "My Certificate" "24h" "Server" (list "localhost") (registry "my-ca-key") (registry "my-ca-cert") }}
----

.Recursive Template Processing
[TIP]
====
This example demonstrates the use of dynamic function arguments.
The private key associated with the certificate is provided as a PEM encoded string.
In this example we recursively lookup the certificate from the registry with `(registry "my-key")`.
====

.Automatic Certificate Rotation
[TIP]
====
The Service Broker is reactive--it responds to API calls--therefore will never support certificate rotation directly.
You should deploy a certificate manager with your service instances if this functionality is required by your security policy.
====

[#generate-pet-name]
==== Generate Pet name

The pet name generator generates a random string consisting of a specific number of words separated by '-'. 

The resulting string comprises of random adverbs, an adjective, and an animal name.
The parameter defines the number of elements to include in the name, and must be an integer greater than or equal to 1.

For example, to generate a 3 word string:

[source]
----
{{ generatePetName 3 }}
----

.Pet Name Randomness
[TIP]
====
While pet names are generally easy to communicate between humans, there are limitations to their use.
Dictionary size is a concern as that gives rise to the possibility of pet name collisions.
As an example, a 2 element pet name is likely to generate the same name as one that already exists within about 500 calls.
For this reason it's highly recommended to compose resource names with an additional source of cryptographic entropy:

[source]
----
{{ printf "%s-%s" (generatePetName 2) (generatePassword 8 nil) }}
----
====

=== Assertions

Assertions allow error checking to be performed earlier in the pipeline to raise errors in a more constrained manner.

==== Required

The required function will raise an error if the input argument is `nil`.

[source]
----
{{ parameter "/password" | required }}
----

== Next Steps

The final step to explain the Service Broker configuration is to look at the registry.
This is the last fundamental component of the Service Broker that must be understood in order to use and configure it effectively.
